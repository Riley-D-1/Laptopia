# Laptopia
A website all about finding infomation about laptops. It includes a web scraper and a website that updates when you run the scraper.

## Why did I make this project
## How did I hit the theme?
- I included framework laptops in the db (obviously)
- The Bg is the framework logo (~~slight~~ no bias tho in the db [joking fyi])
- I scraped a website that has a framework (jk, surely the first two are enough for theme tho)

# Scraped data off Jbhifi (added in some laptops (such as framework) manually)


## Important, when scraping ensure that the product count matches to ensure all links were scraped. It may take 2 or more attempts, unable to fix in timeframe (also can change the delay to be longer to solve)
### Following these rules
