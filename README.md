# Laptopia
A website all about finding infomation about laptops. It includes a web scraper and a website that updates when you run the scraper.
Laptopia is a data base of over 300+ laptops (including our beloved frameworks)
## Why did I make this project
- I love tech and nerding out about stats and wanted a quick comparison site not filled with ads and junk.
- I also wanted to see how framework laptops compare to the competition in a collection of catagories
## How did I hit the theme?
- I included framework laptops in the db (obviously)
- The Bg is the framework logo (~~slight~~ no bias tho in the db [joking fyi])
- I scraped a website that has a framework (jk, surely the first two are enough for theme tho)
## Where did the data come from and is it reputable?
- Scraped data off Jbhifi (added in framework laptops manually)


## Important
- When scraping ensure that the product count matches to ensure all links were scraped. It may take 2 or more attempts, unable to fix in timeframe (also can change the delay to be longer to solve)
- I would not reccomend rescraping as it takes about 15~ mins but you can, (for index rename the first column from "" to "Index" and remove the very last line if its empty.)
- And I know columns are missing but some change the name and ran out of time
